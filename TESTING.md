## Code Validation

### HTML

HTML code was validated using the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) and pasting the code into the text area.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| base.html | ![screenshot of base.html errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/base-initial-errors.png) | I have a lot of errors but as shown in the screenshot they're all in some part caused by the Jinja templating which I believe it done correctly. The "text not allowed in ul" error is also due to having Jinja templating there too. |
| welcome.html | ![screenshot of welcome.html errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/welcome%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | All errors apart from one stem from Jinja templating, so I will be ignoring them. Lone actual error from putting a h2 element within a span |
| welcome.html | ![screenshot of welcome.html with only jinja errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/welcome%20page%20h2%20inside%20span%20fixed.png) | Fixed by moving the h2 element outside of the span element. |
| register.html | ![screenshot of register.html errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/register%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | All but one error due to Jinja templating. The other was because I used a closing h2 tag for a h3 element. |
| register.html | ![screenshot of register.html with only jinja errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/register%20page%20h3%20element%20fixed.png) | Fixed by replacing closing h2 tag with correct closing h3 tag. |
| login.html | ![screenshot of login.html with only jinja errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/log%20in%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | All errors due to Jinja templating and can therefore be ignored. |
| entries.html | ![screenshot of entries.html errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/entries%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | Most errors from Jinja templating, others from Materialize classes like `col` and `s4`. These can be ignored. Some errors due to syntax which will be fixed. |
| entries.html | ![screenshot of entries.html with only jinja and materialize errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/entries%20page%20syntax%20errors%20fixed.png) | Fixed syntax errors by removing the `em` element in the delete modals and by putting a closing `span` tag where they were missing under the individual tab code for the edit and delete buttons. |
| new_entry.html | ![screenshot of new_entry.html with only jinja errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/new%20entry%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | All errors due to Jinja templating and therefore can be ignored. |
| edit_entry.html | ![screenshot of edit_entry.html with only jinja errors](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/html/edit%20entry%20page%20initial%20errors.png) | All errors due to Jinja templating and therefore can be ignored. |


### CSS

CSS code was validated using [W3 Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| static/css/style.css | ![screenshot of initial css validation](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/css/css%20initial%20validation.png) | Some errors resulting from semi colons being in the wrong place. |
| static/css/style.css | ![screenshot of css validation pass](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/css/css%20validation%20pass.png) | Fixed by moving the semi colons into the correct place. No other errors found. |


### Javascript

I only used Javascript for JQuery code to initialise Materialize components.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| static/js/script.js | ![screenshot of js validation](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/js/javascript%20validation.png) | One undefined variable which is the JQuery global selector so this is fine. |

### Python

To validate my Python code, I used [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) to see problems on the fly and [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to format my Python code automatically upon saving, especially helpful for line breaks. This was all done within my IDE itself

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| app.py | ![screenshot of python problems](/readme-documentation/screenshots/validation_screenshots/python/python%20problems.png) | The problems I have got would be what I consider to be totally irrelevant as the functions all work as intended. |
| env.py | Refer to above screenshot | env.py works as intended. |

## Browser Compatibility

I used the following browsers to test the compability of my website with them.

## Bugs/Issues

I didn't run into too many major bugs or issues that took any reasonable time to sort out, part of the joy of building simple. Most of the fixes came from tinkering with my Python code or making sure closing divs were in the right place. I tried not to use google too much for Python because the suggestions were things I had never seen before and would be able to understand which is a prerequisite for me as I want to understand what's going on.

* My major issue is the filter sometimes not working, I have absolutely no idea why as the dates are stored the same way sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Searching for a solution throws me ideas that a. don't make sense to me and b. don't work either.
    * The issue seems to be that it's sorting by the day correctly but ignoring month and year.
        * This was solved by implimenting datetime modules instead of strings, and then re entering the data I had inputted already. The errors appeared to be springing because there were still string inputs in my entries from previous testing so even though I had originally got my code correct I was still getting errors. Once I realised this it was a relatively straightforward fix with a bit of Googling and removing the original entries.

* I encountered this error shown below when I tried to add a new entry, this was after I cleaned up the white space and indenting of my code so potentially I did something wrong there.
![screenshot of server error for adding entry](/readme-documentation/screenshots/general/add_entry_error.png)

    * The error was due to me having put square brackets around the `"swim_date"` instead of normal brackets. Fixed:
    ![screenshot of what i changed to fix add entry error](/readme-documentation/screenshots/general/add%20entry%20error%20fix.png)

* Tried to include Materialize's footer on my Welcome page but couldn't get it to work properly and stick to the bottom.
    * I ended up fixing this by simply attaching the footer content to the card panel underneath the register and log in buttons.
        * UPDATE: I tried the footer again but this time didn't use Materialize's own footer, I just used the footer semantic element and a bit of custom styling to get it to stick to the bottom.

* When building the filter feature, I noticed that when I edited an entry it would be filtered separately to the other entries for reasons unclear to me.
    * I believe I fixed this by just simplifying the sorting code I had. Google had told me about datetime and how to convert dates into strings and vice versa so I tried that and it made the issue worse so I removed all that.
        * UPDATE: As stated above, the issue was because of a mixture of string type dates and datetime type dates. Once I used all datetime dates it worked as expected.

* In my style.css file at the top I've used the global selector `*` to apply my chosen font to all the text. The issue I had was that it wasn't applying to the Materialize selected options in my add and entry entry pages.
    * Again, a good Google search helped to find the exact css code I needed to target to change the font as well as the colour and that I had to use `!important` as well to get the changes to take effect.

* In my `edit_entry.html` form, the date input field was taking up a full row despite me specifying `col s6 offset-s3` in the classes.
    * Turns out I had a closing `div` on the end of the line with the opening `div` instead of under the block of code I wanted the classes to apply to. This was the only closing div mistake that took me a while to catch.

* The Materialize date picker does not work very well on mobile devices.

* I couldn't work out how to make it so the flash() messages have something for the user to click on to get rid of them.

* I noticed that the delete function was only deleting the top entry regardless of which entry I clicked on. I assume this is due to the delete modal not actually targetting the correct entry and therefore only getting the top entry. I will try and fix this by using the `._id` of entries.
    * As expected, by adding `._id` to the modal's ID instead of the generic `delete-modal-1` I had before, I essentially make a unique modal for each entry which displays properly.
